### Introduction
The [Civic Digital Fellowship](https://www.codingitforward.com/summer-fellowships) is empowering the next generation of technology leaders to innovate at the intersections of technology and public service in federal government offices across the United States. Fellows work across software engineering, data, design, and product management to deliver policy, improve systems, and strengthen products on behalf of the American people. 

We are grateful for agency partners who provided our Fellows with the opportunity to serve and grow this summer: the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://bjs.ojp.gov/), the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/), the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/), the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/), [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/), the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/), the [Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/), [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.irs.gov/), the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/), and [U.S. Special Operations Command](https://www.socom.mil/).
